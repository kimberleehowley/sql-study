# Chapter 6: Joining tables in a relational database 

- JOIN keyword to JOIN tables 
- CONSTRAINT when creating a table to make sure that right values are added 
- Joins are useful for finding table overlaps, e.g. asking questions like, "What values exist in both tables?" 
- JOIN will give you just the overlap, NOT all values in both tables 
- A LEFT or RIGHT JOIN is useful for looking for missing values
- A CROSS JOIN returns all possible matches 
- Use `WHERE value IS NULL` with Joins to find missing values 
- Dot notation specifies column names after te table name 
- You can create the alias for the table name in the FROM clause 
- JOIN also useful for comparing old data to new
