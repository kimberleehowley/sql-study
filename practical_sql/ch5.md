# Chapter 5: Basic math stats with SQL 

### Some functions
- ROUND() by default removes all but one decimal 
- AVERAGE() gets an average 

### Percentile functions
- _cont(n) -> outside dataset
- _disc(n) -> dataset 
- Can use these to get a group of values in a percentile 

### Other notes
- A median can be useful when there are significant outliers in data 
- There are arrays and array methods in SQL! E.g. unnest to get an array into separate rows
