# Mining text to find meaningful data 

## Formatting text using string functions 

### Case formatting 
- upper(_string_): Capitalizes all letters of string parameter passed in (numbers unaffected)
- lower(_string_)
- initcap(_string_): Capitalizes first letter of each word of a string; just doesn't recognize acronyms; is also PostgreSQL-specific 

### Character information 
- char_length(_string_): Returns the character count of a string passed in 
- position(_substring_ in _string_): Returns where that substring is 

### Removing characters 
- trim(_characters_ from _string_)
- Add trailing or leading before _character_ in the query to get only the first or last 

### Extracting and replacing characters 
- left(_string_, _number_) and right(_string_, _number_) extract and return selected chars from string 
- replace(_string_, _original_from_, _change_to_)

## Matching text patterns with regular expressions 
- Regex: notational language; describes text patterns 

### Regular expression notation 
- Useful for selecting only relevant parts of a string, for locating patterns 
- Implement in the form of a substring, e.g. `SELECT substring('Sample sentence." FROM 'regex');`

### Turning text to data with regex 
- Basically, we can import full text into a database, then use SQL and regex to extract relevant bits and put into columns 
- `regexp_match()` 
- `regexp_matches('regex', 'g')`: returns each  match, not just the first (duplicates)

### Matching additional elements 
- \d+ matches any digit that appears one or more times. 

### Extracting Text from regexp_match() 
- To remove curly brackets, you need to use array notation, e.g. putting the number in square brackets after the regex expression, which should also be enclosed in curly brackets
