# Saving time with views, functions, and triggers 

## Views to simplify queries 
- Virtual table dynamically created using saved query 
- You can query a view (can even select specific column names)
- Define with `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` 
- Useful for questions that need to be looked at often, like percent change, not necessarily seeing a whole list or data on one survey like I need (I don't think)

## Programming your own functions 
- Reusable code in MySQL happens in a _stored procedure_. 
- Can use to update data regularly. 
- Extensions may be available in MySQL for Python (they are in PostgreSQL)

## Triggers 
- _Trigger_ executes a function whenever a specified event occurs
