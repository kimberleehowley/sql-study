# Saving time with views, functions, and triggers 

## Views to simplify queries 
- Virtual table dynamically created using saved query 
- You can query a view (can even select specific column names)
- Define with `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` 
- Useful for questions that need to be looked at often, like percent change, not necessarily seeing a whole list or data on one survey like I need (I don't think)
