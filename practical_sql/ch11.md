# Working with dates and times 

## Data types for dates and times 
_Datetime types_ 
- `date`: records ony the date, ISO format recommended YYYY-MM-DD
- `time`: only the time, HH:MM:SS
- `timestamp`: date and time, use `timestamp with timezone` to get timezone 
_Interval type_ 
- `interval`: holds set unit of time, expressed in format `quantity unit` 

## Manipulating dates and times 
_Most of the book references POSTgreSQL, reference documentation for your language_. 

### Extracting timestamp components 
- `date_part(text, value)`
    - text: part of the date to extract, e.g. hour, minute, week 
    - value: date, time, or timestamp value 
- *MySQL* `EXTRACT (part FROM date)

### Creating datetime values from timestamp components 
_MySQL referenced_ 
- `MAKEDATE(year, month, day)`
- `MAKETIME(hour, minute, seconds)`
- `TIMESTAMP(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, time zone)`

### Retrieving the current date and time 
_MySQL referenced_ 
- `CURDATE()`: returns current date 
- `NOW()`: returns current date and time 
- `CURRENT_TIME()`
- `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`
- `LOCALTIME()`
- `LOCALTIMESTAMP()`
- In PostgreSQL, there's a `clock_timestamp()` function that returns exact time when a value is added to a row 

## Working with time zones 

### Finding your time zone setting
- Database adminstrators often set shared to UTC 
- Figure it out with `SHOW timezone` 
- `SHOW ALL` shows every parameter 

### Setting the time zone 
- `SET timezone TO 'String time zone'` 
- Keyword `AT TIME ZONE 'String'` shows us the time in a particular timezone we're curious about 

## Calculations with dates and times 
- You can perform math on dates!
