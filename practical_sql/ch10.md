# Statistical functions in SQL 

## Creating a census stats table 
- A CHECK constraint can verify that data behaves as you expect, e.g. that there is the percentage of people with masters degrees is less than or equal to the percentage with bachelors, since all masters degrees will have to have bachelors first: 
`CHECK (pct_masters_higher <= pct_bachelors_higher)`

### Measuring correlation with corr(Y, X)
* _Pearson correlation coefficient_: quantifies the strength of a _linear relationship_ between two variables, e.g. how much an increase or decrease in one variable impacts a change in another. 1 or -1 indicates a perfect correlation, butanywhere close to zero is random distribution. 
    - Positive r : direct relationship 
    - Negative r: inverse relationship, as one variable increases, the other decreases 
* corr(Y, X) is a _binary aggregate function_. 
    - Input Y depends on value of another variable (dependent)
    - X is independent, doesnt' depend on another 
- Example question: How does income correlate with education? 
`SELECT corr(income, education) 
    AS education_income_r
FROM acs_2011_2015_stats;` 

### Checking additional correlations 
- We can change data types using `::numeric` after stating what it is we're selecting.

### Predicting values with regression analysis 
- _Linear regression_: Finds the best straight line that describes relationship between independent variable (education) and dependent variable (income).
- _Least squares regression line_: Line that approximates best fit for a straight line that describes relationship, calculated with `Y = bX + a`; 
    - Where: Y is the predicted value (dependent variable), b is slope, or how many units the y value will increase or decrease, X is independent variable, a is y-intercept 
- `regr_slope(Y, X)`: gets us the slope of the line, b
- `regr_intercept(Y, X)`: grabs the intercept
