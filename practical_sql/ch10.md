# Statistical functions in SQL 

## Creating a census stats table 
- A CHECK constraint can verify that data behaves as you expect, e.g. that there is the percentage of people with masters degrees is less than or equal to the percentage with bachelors, since all masters degrees will have to have bachelors first: 
`CHECK (pct_masters_higher <= pct_bachelors_higher)`

### Measuring correlation with corr(Y, X)
* _Pearson correlation coefficient_: quantifies the strength of a _linear relationship_ between two variables, e.g. how much an increase or decrease in one variable impacts a change in another. 1 or -1 indicates a perfect correlation, butanywhere close to zero is random distribution. 
    - Positive r : direct relationship 
    - Negative r: inverse relationship, as one variable increases, the other decreases 
* corr(Y, X) is a _binary aggregate function_. 
    - Input Y depends on value of another variable (dependent)
    - X is independent, doesnt' depend on another 
- Example question: How does income correlate with education? 
`SELECT corr(income, education) 
    AS education_income_r
FROM acs_2011_2015_stats;` 

### Checking additional correlations 
- We can change data types using `::numeric` after stating what it is we're selecting.

### Predicting values with regression analysis 
- _Linear regression_: Finds the best straight line that describes relationship between independent variable (education) and dependent variable (income).
- _Least squares regression line_: Line that approximates best fit for a straight line that describes relationship, calculated with `Y = bX + a`; 
    - Where: Y is the predicted value (dependent variable), b is slope, or how many units the y value will increase or decrease, X is independent variable, a is y-intercept 
- `regr_slope(Y, X)`: gets us the slope of the line, b
- `regr_intercept(Y, X)`: grabs the intercept 

### Finding the effect of an independent variable with r-squared 
- _Coefficient of determination_ (r-squared): represents the percentage of a variation that can be explained by an independent variable 
- `regr_2(Y, X) function in SQL`
- Correlation is not equal to causation: e.g. divorce rate in Maine and margarine consumption 
- _Significance testing_ evaluates whether results come from randomness
- Basically, SQL's built-in functions are just the beginning 

## Creating rankings with SQL 

### Ranking with rank() and dense_rank()
- _Window functions_: Perform calculations over specified rows using OVER. They present results for each row in the table. 
- `rank()`: includes a gap in rank order 
- `dense_rank()`: does not include gaps 

### Ranking within subgroups with partition by 
- E.g. ranking employees by salary within department; rank movies by earnings within genre 
- Tells the program, "Create rankings one category at a time" 
`SELECT category, store, unit_sales rank() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY unit_sales DESC) FROM store_sales`;
