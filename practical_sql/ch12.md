# Advanced query techniques 

## Usng subqueries 
- Can use to write a subquery that returns multiple rows and treat the results as a table in FROM of the main query 
- `Scalar subquery`: returns a single value, used to filter rows using WHERE, IN, HAVING 
- `Correlated subquery`: depends on value or table name from main query that surrounds it 
- `Uncorrelated subquery`: no reference to objects 

### Filtering with subqueries in a WHERE clause
- E.g. If you only want the top 10% of something like population (90th percentile), you can write that as a subquery instead of two separate queries 
`SELECT name, population 
FROM table 
WHERE population >= (SELECT percentile_cont(.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population) FROM table) ORDER BY population DESC`
- Use WHERE in the same way above! Just use DELETE instead of the first SELECT. 

### Creating derived tables with subqueries 
- Place your subquery in a FROM clause to make it a table, making it a `derived table` 
- Then name it with an alias so you can reference it in SELECT, e.g.: 

`SELECT round(calcs.average, 0) as average,
       calcs.median,
       round(calcs.average - calcs.median, 0) AS median_average_diff
FROM (
     SELECT avg(p0010001) AS average,
            percentile_cont(.5)
                WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001)::numeric(10,1) AS median
     FROM us_counties_2010
     )
AS calcs;`

### Joining derived tables 
- A subquery being used as a table can be joined with another; behavior is same as tables 
- Just list the subquery within the JOIN and give it an alias 

### Generating columns with subqueries 
- Just list the subquery right after SELECT, where column selections go! 
- Put it all in parens, then alias, e.g. 
`(SELECT percentile_cont(.5) WITIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001) FROM us_counties_2010) AS us_median 
- You can also do math in the select with that subquery, just list it where columns are selected as well 
- Subqueries do take a tone of time! Inefficient. 

### Subquery expressions 
- Allow us to use subqueries like a filter, e.g. generating values for IN: 
`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM retirees);` 
- If there are NULL values, we'll wan to use EXISTS keyword 

#### Checking whether values exist 
- EXISTS in a subquery is a true/false test. Evaluates to true if subquery returns at least one row; false if otherwise. 
- Can use NOT keyword as well

## Common table expressions 
- CTEs let you define one or more tables upfront WITH subqueries (using WITH keyword)
`WITH table alias (column1, column2, column3) AS (SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table2) SELECT values FROM tablie alias`
- You can prestage subsets of data to feed into a larger query for more complex analysis 

## Cross tabulations 
- Display variables in a table layout / matrix!
- Also called pivot tables or crosstabs 
- E.g. candidates votes tallied by geography: names, geographic regions are variables; cells at intersection hold tallies for votes in each geo 
- In PostgreSQL, run command CREATE EXTENSION tablefunc; other languages use PIVOT function 
- Two subqueries is part of the formula for generating 

## Reclassifyng values with CASE 
- "If this, then..." logic to a query 
- Useful for categorizing data in ranges 

`CASE WHEN _condition_ THEN _result_ 
    WHEN _another_condition_ THEN _result_ 
    ELSE _result_
END`    

- We need that ELSE clause so the system doesn't return NULL 

## CASE in a CTE 
- WITH defines the CTE, which can be used to recategorize values 
- Then separate SELECT can be performed on CTE
