# Advanced query techniques 

## Usng subqueries 
- Can use to write a subquery that returns multiple rows and treat the results as a table in FROM of the main query 
- `Scalar subquery`: returns a single value, used to filter rows using WHERE, IN, HAVING 
- `Correlated subquery`: depends on value or table name from main query that surrounds it 
- `Uncorrelated subquery`: no reference to objects 

### Filtering with subqueries in a WHERE clause
- E.g. If you only want the top 10% of something like population (90th percentile), you can write that as a subquery instead of two separate queries 
`SELECT name, population 
FROM table 
WHERE population >= (SELECT percentile_cont(.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY population) FROM table) ORDER BY population DESC`
- Use WHERE in the same way above! Just use DELETE instead of the first SELECT. 

### Creating derived tables with subqueries 
- Place your subquery in a FROM clause to make it a table, making it a `derived table` 
- Then name it with an alias so you can reference it in SELECT, e.g.: 

`SELECT round(calcs.average, 0) as average,
       calcs.median,
       round(calcs.average - calcs.median, 0) AS median_average_diff
FROM (
     SELECT avg(p0010001) AS average,
            percentile_cont(.5)
                WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001)::numeric(10,1) AS median
     FROM us_counties_2010
     )
AS calcs;`
