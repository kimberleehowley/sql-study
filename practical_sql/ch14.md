# Analyzing spatial data with POSTGIS 

- GIS: geographic information system 
- _Spatial data_: information about location and shape of objects, sometimes 2 or 3 dimensional 
- PostGIS is an open-source extension that lets PostgreSQL make use of spatial data 
- You need to install the OSS, then `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;` 

## Building blocks of spatial data 
- Point on a grid: smallest building block of spatial data 
- That grid could include X, Y, latitude, longitude, etc. 
- LineString: Two or more points connected by a straight line 
- Polygon: Two-dimensional shape with three or more straight lines from LineStrings. Often represents something important. 
- MultiPoint: Set of points representing multiple instances, e.g. multiple store locations 
- MultiLineString: represents roads often 
- MultiPolygon: representing parcels or groups of things 
- To create spatial data, you'll need inputs of _well-known text_ (WKT) string plus a _Spatial reference system identifier_ (SRID)
- WKT format: includes geometry type and coordinates inside parentheses 
- Know what coordinate system your geographic data comes from 

## PostGIS 
- Geography data type: more precises, because based on curvature 
- Geometry data type: based on plane (Euclidean), less precise; but better for smaller data, only latitude and longitude, and performance 
- `ST_GeomFromText(WKT, SRID)`: creates geometry data type 
- There are also functions that exist for the specific kinds of geometry types, including lines and polygons 
- Useful to create an index that is a Generalized Search Tree format (GiST)
- `ST_DWithin()`: returns a boolean about whether or not object is within distance of another object
- `ST_Distance()`: returns minimum distance between two objects 
- Shapefiles, developed by Esri, contain information describing the shape of the feature 
- `ST_Area()` 
- Spatial joins: useful for figuring how many of what are where 
- `ST_Intersection()`: Location of place where objects cross
